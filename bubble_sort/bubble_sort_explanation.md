# Bubble Sort Explanation and Complexity

### Explanation of the Algorithm:

- **Bubble Sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
- The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list (beginning of the list) as the sorting progresses.

### Computational Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: The worst-case time complexity of Bubble Sort is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the list. This scenario occurs when the list is sorted in reverse order, requiring the maximum number of swaps.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of Bubble Sort is \(O(1)\). It is an in-place sorting algorithm since it requires a constant amount of additional space regardless of the input list size.

### Characteristics:

- **Adaptive**: Bubble sort is adaptive; it can finish early if the list becomes sorted before making all the passes. However, as implemented above, it doesn't check for this condition. An optimization could be added to terminate the outer loop if no swaps are made in an inner loop iteration.
- **Stable**: Bubble sort is stable; it maintains the relative order of equal elements.
- **Simple**: It is one of the simplest sorting algorithms to understand and implement, making it suitable for educational purposes, although it is not efficient on large lists compared to more advanced algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort.
