# Python Sorting Algorithms

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to showcasing implementations of fundamental sorting algorithms in Python. It serves as an educational resource for understanding how different sorting algorithms work and their efficiency. Featured within this repository are implementations of Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort.

## Repository Structure
Each sorting algorithm is contained within its own folder, structured as follows:

- `bubble_sort_algorithm/`
  - `bubble_sort.py` - The Python script implementing the Bubble Sort algorithm.
  - `README.md` - An explanation of the Bubble Sort algorithm and its complexity.
- `insertion_sort_algorithm/`
  - `insertion_sort.py` - The Python script implementing the Insertion Sort algorithm.
  - `README.md` - An explanation of the Insertion Sort algorithm and its complexity.
- `merge_sort_algorithm/`
  - `merge_sort.py` - The Python script implementing the Merge Sort algorithm.
  - `README.md` - An explanation of the Merge Sort algorithm and its complexity.

This structure is followed for all sorting algorithms included in this repository.

## Getting Started
To utilize these scripts, you must have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository: 
https://github.com/ungest/sorting-algorithms.git

2. Navigate to the desired sorting algorithm directory:
